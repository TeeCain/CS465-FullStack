Architecture:
In developing the Travlr web server, I utilized various types of front-end development, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and a single-page application (SPA) built with Angular. The Express HTML approach was straightforward for rendering static pages and handling server-side logic, but it lacked the interactivity and fluid user experience of an SPA. JavaScript was essential for both, enhancing the static pages with dynamic features and forming the backbone of the Angular SPA. The SPA architecture provided a more modular and maintainable codebase, with components and services that encapsulated specific functionalities. This modularity allowed for a more scalable and responsive user interface.

The backend employed a NoSQL MongoDB database, as it has flexibility in handling diverse data types and easy scalability. MongoDB's schema-less nature allowed me to iterate rapidly on the database design. This was particularly beneficial for the dynamic data models required by the Travlr application, such as user-generated content and travel itinerary details. MongoDB's horizontal scaling capabilities ensured that the backend could handle increasing loads as the user base grew.

Functionality:
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate. Unlike JavaScript, which is a full-fledged programming language, JSON is purely a data format used to represent structured data. In the context of the Travlr web server, JSON served as the common language between the frontend and backend, enabling seamless data exchange. This standardized data format was crucial for maintaining consistency and interoperability between different parts of the application.

Throughout the full stack development process, refactoring code was essential to enhance functionality and efficiency. One notable instance was optimizing the data fetching logic in the Angular application to reduce redundant API calls. Additionally, creating reusable UI components, such as date pickers and form validators, not only reduced code duplication but also ensured a consistent look and feel across the application. These reusable components enhanced maintainability and allowed for quicker development of new features.

Testing:
Testing the Travlr SPA involved a comprehensive approach to ensure the robustness of API endpoints and the security of the application. API testing included verifying the correctness of GET and PUT requests with manual testing tools like Postman, ensuring that data was accurately retrieved and updated in the MongoDB database. Security testing was particularly challenging due to the need to protect sensitive data and prevent unauthorized access. Implementing and testing authentication mechanisms, such as JSON Web Tokens (JWT), was crucial for securing the endpoints. Techniques like input validation and sanitization were employed to defend against common security threats, such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
